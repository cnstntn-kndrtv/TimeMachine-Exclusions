# TimeMachine-Exclusions
Simple automator app for list exclusions form TimeMachine backups

## Why?
I found nice utility [Azimov](https://github.com/stevegrunwell/asimov) 
For list all of excluded folders you can run one simple command `sudo mdfind \"com_apple_backup_excludeItem = 'com.apple.backupd'\"`.  
But I always forgetting all of that wired shell commands.
